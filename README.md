# OctreeSplatting
A demo of CPU octree splatting algorithm

The overview / explanation of the used techniques is in the [Notes/Overview.md](Notes/Overview.md) file.

***2024 update:*** I also made a C library based on these (and some new) ideas, take a look at the [Discrete Mirage](https://github.com/dairin0d/discrete-mirage) project if you're interested :-)

A short video demonstration of the main features:

The Unity demo also contains an [experiment](Unity/OctreeSplatting/Assets/VoxelStackRendering.Demo) with orthographic VoxelSpace-inspired rendering and line-of-sight effect. A video demonstration of this experiment can be seen here:
